# Permissions on macOS

## Overview

Grant the app access to Microphone, Screen Recording, and Accessibility under System Settings so it can function correctly.

## Prerequisites

- macOS with administrator access

## Steps

1. Open System Settings -> Privacy & Security.
2. Microphone: enable the app in the Microphone section.
3. Screen Recording: enable the app in the Screen Recording section (macOS may require quitting the app).
4. Accessibility: click the lock to allow changes, then enable the app.
5. Restart the app to apply changes.

## Why these permissions

- Microphone: speech-to-text and audio features.
- Screen Recording: screenshots and on-screen analysis.
- Accessibility: global hotkeys and UI automation when required.

## Troubleshooting

- App missing: open the app once so macOS registers it, then revisit settings.
- Still blocked: toggle permissions off/on and reboot.
