# Stealth Mode

## Overview
Stealth Mode reduces the app’s visible UI and notifications so you can use Perssua discreetly during calls or screen shares. It minimizes panels and visual hints while preserving productivity features (e.g., screenshots, analysis, chat navigation).  
**Important:** always double-check Stealth Mode in a test call before using it live.

## Prerequisites
- Perssua app installed and updated.
- OS permissions granted (Screen Recording for screenshots; Microphone for audio features).
- Video-conferencing app configured (see **Zoom limitations & settings** below).

## Steps
1. Open **Settings → Stealth Mode**.
2. Toggle **Stealth Mode** **On**.
3. *(Optional)* Adjust visibility preferences (e.g., hide floating panel, mute in-app sounds, suppress notifications) if available on your build.
4. Start or join a call and share your screen.
5. Use shortcuts for quick actions without exposing the UI:
   - **Ctrl + B** → Toggle app visibility (quick hide/show).
   - **Ctrl + E** → Capture a screenshot.
   - **Ctrl + Enter** → Analyze the most recent screenshot.
   - **Ctrl + Up/Down** → Scroll the Perssua chat.
   - **Ctrl + D** → Record & transcribe audio.
6. Verify with a colleague (or a second device) that Perssua’s UI is not visible to viewers.
7. After the call, turn **Stealth Mode** off if you want full UI back.

## Zoom limitations & settings
- **macOS permissions:**  
  - Give Perssua permission in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording** (and **Microphone** if you’ll capture audio).
- **What you share matters:**  
  - Prefer **Window** or **Screen portion** sharing instead of your **entire desktop** to reduce the chance of overlays appearing to viewers.
- **Zoom UI visibility:**  
  - In **Zoom → Settings → Share Screen**, review options such as **Show Zoom windows during screen share**. Disabling this typically reduces on-screen clutter.  
- **Dual-monitor tip:**  
  - If possible, keep Perssua on a **second monitor** that you’re **not** sharing.
- **Always test:**  
  - Do a **test meeting** and screen share to confirm what viewers see.

## Shortcuts
- **Ctrl + B** — Toggle app visibility.  
- **Ctrl + E** — Capture screenshot.  
- **Ctrl + Enter** — Analyze last screenshot.  
- **Ctrl + Up/Down** — Scroll Perssua chat up/down.  
- **Ctrl + D** — Record & transcribe audio.

## Tips
- Combine **Ctrl + E** (capture) with **Ctrl + Enter** (analyze) for fast feedback loops without opening panels.
- Keep **Ctrl + B** handy to instantly hide/show the app if you need to glance at the UI.
- For privacy and compliance, get consent before recording or transcribing audio.

## Troubleshooting
- **Viewers can see the overlay:**  
  - Switch to **window sharing**, move Perssua to a non-shared display, or toggle **Ctrl + B** to hide visibility.
- **Screenshot capture fails:**  
  - Re-check OS **Screen Recording** permissions and restart the app.
- **No audio captured:**  
  - Select the correct device in **Settings → Audio** and verify OS microphone permissions.
- **Shortcuts not working:**  
  - Ensure Perssua is the active window, or check if another app is intercepting the hotkeys.
