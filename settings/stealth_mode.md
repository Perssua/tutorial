# Stealth Mode

## Overview

Stealth Mode hides the assistant overlay from screen sharing and recordings so you can get help without exposing the UI to others.

## Prerequisites

- Application installed and running
- Screen-sharing app (e.g., Zoom) available for testing

## Steps

1. Open the app and go to Settings -> Stealth Mode.
2. Read the warning and confirm you understand the implications.
3. Enable the Stealth Mode toggle. The overlay should remain visible to you locally but be hidden from captures.
4. Join a meeting and share your screen to verify the overlay is not visible to participants.
5. To show the overlay again, return to Settings -> Stealth Mode and disable it.

## Tips

- Double-check before presenting. Different meeting apps can behave differently.
- Test in advance with a colleague to confirm the effect.

## Troubleshooting

- If the overlay still appears on stream: restart the meeting app and re-toggle Stealth Mode.
- On macOS, ensure Screen Recording permission is granted to the app in System Settings -> Privacy & Security.
