# Permissions on Windows

## Overview

Grant the app access to microphone, screen recording, and accessibility features so it can capture audio and assist effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11
- Administrator rights may be required

## Steps

1. Microphone: Settings -> Privacy & security -> Microphone -> Allow access, then enable the app.
2. Screen recording: Settings -> Privacy & security -> Screen recording (Windows 11) -> Allow access and enable the app.
3. Accessibility (if needed): Settings -> Accessibility -> Keyboard/Mouse -> Allow the app to control input where applicable.
4. Restart the app to apply changes.

## Why these permissions

- Microphone: capture your speech for transcription.
- Screen recording: capture screenshots or specific windows for analysis.
- Accessibility: enable global shortcuts and interaction with UI elements (if the feature requires it).

## Troubleshooting

- App not listed: launch the app once, then revisit the permission pages.
- Changes not applied: toggle off/on and reboot the PC.
