# Screenshot Analyses

## Overview

Capture screenshots and ask the assistant to analyze them. Add extra context in the ASK field for better results.

## Prerequisites

- Screen Recording permission granted in the OS

## Steps

1. Press the Screenshot button or use the shortcut to capture the current window/area.
2. Review the captured image in the modal and write a question or context in the ASK field (e.g., "Explain this error message").
3. Click Send to submit the screenshot and text to the AI.
4. Read the AI's response in the chat panel.

## Tips

- Provide relevant context (environment, steps taken) in the ASK field.
- Redact sensitive data before submitting.

## Limitations

- Free tier may limit the number of screenshots per day.
- Large/complex images may take longer to process.

## Troubleshooting

- Capture failed: ensure Screen Recording permission is enabled.
- Wrong window: retake the screenshot with the correct focus/area.
