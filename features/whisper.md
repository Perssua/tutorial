# Whisper

## Overview

Whisper transcribes your voice and can send transcripts to the AI. Use manual mode for on-demand capture or automatic mode to transcribe every N seconds.

## Prerequisites

- Working microphone selected in the app

## Steps

1. Open Features -> Whisper.
2. Manual: click the Microphone icon (or use the shortcut) to capture speech, then click Send.
3. Automatic: toggle Auto Transcribe and set the interval (e.g., 10s). The app will periodically send recent audio for analysis.
4. Review responses in the chat panel.

## Audio settings

- Choose the correct input device in Settings -> Audio.
- Adjust noise suppression and input level as needed.

## Tips

- Continuous transcription may consume credits; use sensible intervals.

## Troubleshooting

- No input detected: select the right microphone and check OS permissions.
- Delays: reduce interval length or close background apps.
