# Choosing a Prompt

## Overview

Prompts shape the assistant's behavior. Pick a predefined prompt or create a custom one (premium) for tailored results.

## Prerequisites

- Premium plan for custom prompts (if required)

## Steps

1. Open Features -> Prompt Selection.
2. Review available presets (e.g., General Assistant, Code Helper, Meeting Summarizer).
3. Select a preset to apply it immediately.
4. (Premium) Create Custom Prompt: provide a name and write a concise system prompt.
5. Save and select your custom prompt for future sessions.

## Best practices

- Be clear about objectives, tone, and constraints.
- Keep prompts concise; avoid redundant instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- Custom prompt not saving: check plan limits and ensure required fields are filled.
