## Overview
The app includes a set of keyboard shortcuts to improve speed and usability. These allow you to quickly change visibility, capture screenshots, scroll through the Perssua chat, and record or analyze audio without leaving the main workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Perssua app open and active.
- Microphone enabled (for audio capture).
- Necessary permissions granted by the OS (screen and audio access).

## Steps
- **Toggle Visibility:** Press **Ctrl + B** to show or hide the Perssua app.  
- **Capture Screenshot:** Press **Ctrl + E** to take a screenshot.  
- **Scroll Chat Up:** Press **Ctrl + Up Arrow** to scroll upward in the Perssua chat.  
- **Scroll Chat Down:** Press **Ctrl + Down Arrow** to scroll downward in the Perssua chat.  
- **Record & Transcribe Audio:** Press **Ctrl + D** to capture audio and generate a transcript automatically.  
- **Analyze Screenshot:** Press **Ctrl + Enter** to run analysis on the most recent screenshot.  

## Tips
- Use **Ctrl + B** frequently to keep the app discreet during presentations.  
- Combine **Ctrl + E** (screenshot) with **Ctrl + Enter** (analysis) for faster feedback loops.  
- When using **Ctrl + D**, ensure your microphone is properly set to avoid transcription errors.  

## Troubleshooting
- **Shortcuts not responding:** Check if the Perssua app is focused (active window).  
- **Screenshot fails:** Confirm screen capture permissions are enabled in system settings.  
- **No audio recorded:** Re-select your microphone in *Settings -> Audio* and grant OS permissions.
